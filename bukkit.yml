# This is the main configuration file for Bukkit.
# As you can see, there's actually not that much to configure without any plugins.

# Note: If you want to use special characters in this file, such as accented letters, you MUST save the file as UTF-8, not ANSI.
# If you receive an error when Bukkit tries to load this file, ensure that your text editor is set to UTF-8 encoding.
